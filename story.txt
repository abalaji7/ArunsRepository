Once upon a time there was a man named Joe who had a dog named Buddy. One day Joe was taking Buddy out for a walk when they got seperated and Joe ended up losing Buddy. Joe spent hours in the woods looking for buddy but could not find him. Eventually he got all his neighbors involved in the search for Buddy but nobody could find him.

Once upon a time there was a man named Joe who had a dog named Buddy. One day Joe was taking Buddy out for a walk when they got seperated and Joe ended up losing Buddy. Joe spent hours in the woods looking for buddy but could not find him. Eventually he got all his neighbors involved in the search for Buddy but nobody could find him. 

Then, one day, Joe's doorbell rang. Hoping it might be someone with news about Buddy, Joe ran to his door, but when he opened it he saw no one standing there. Instead, he discovered it was another dog! Joe looked around to see if the dog's owner was anywhere to be found, but he didn't see anyone, only the new dog sitting on his porch. The dog motioned eagerly for Joe to follow him. Eventually Joe gave in, letting the dog lead him away from his house and into the woods.

In the Woods joe fell into a river and died.
